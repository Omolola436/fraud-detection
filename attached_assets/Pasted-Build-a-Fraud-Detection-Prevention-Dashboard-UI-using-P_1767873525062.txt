Build a Fraud Detection & Prevention Dashboard UI using:

Python (Flask) for the application server

HTML + CSS (Tailwind CSS) for layout and styling

Vanilla JavaScript for frontend logic (NO TypeScript, NO React)

⚠️ Do NOT use TypeScript, React, Next.js, or any frontend framework.

This project is UI/UX ONLY.
The real ML backend is being built separately and will be connected later.
